LibreDWG version 0.5 - released 2018/07/05:

This is the first public release ever, after several years of silence.
It can read most r13-r2018 DWG files, and write r2000 DWG,
write DXF and GeoJSON files for all versions.
There are also many new programs: dwgread, dwgwrite, dwgrewrite,
dwg2dxf, dwglayers, dwggrep, dwgbmp, dwg2SVG (very basic), dwg2ps (infancy).
See the manual, ChangeLog or git history for details.

The API is usable but still pretty rough, we might still rename
some functions or names for better consistency and add more encoding API.
